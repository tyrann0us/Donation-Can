Collect PayPal donations towards multiple goals on your blog and show the progress to your visitors using sidebar widgets.

== Description ==

Donation Can is a WordPress plugin that lets you set fundraising goals (in multiple currencies) and collect donations to meet them. Donations are
collected through PayPal and can be tracked inside your WordPress admin area separately for each goal.

Key features:

*   Define goals with name, description and amount of money required to meet the goal. For example "Help me buy a MacBook Pro" or "Save the rainforests."
*   Use WordPress widgets and shortcodes to define how and where the donation forms and progress bars are shown in your blog layout.
*   Be notified by email when someone makes a donation to one of your goals.
*   Follow the progress and browse donations inside the WordPress admin area.
*   Get a quick glance at the overall status of your donations using the Donation Can dashboard widget.
*   Easy to customize.

== Installation ==

Donation Can installation follows the standard way of most WordPress plugins:

1. Upload files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (preserve sub-directory structure)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

After the plugin has been installed, set up your PayPal information on the plugin settings page and define your first goal.

IMPORTANT: Donation Can doesn't work with the default permalink settings (The format with URLs such as http://www.example.com/?p=10), 
so you need to select one of the other options to make the plugin work. As a bonus, changing your permalink structure
is also good for Search Engine Optimization.

== Using Donation Can ==

= 1. Creating a donation cause =

Collecting donations through Donation Can starts from creating a donation goal. A goal contains a cause (= a title and
a description of what you are collecting the money for), and a money goal (or no goal for an openended fundraising campaign)
stating how much money you need.

To create a donation goal, click on the "Add New Cause" link in the Donation Can menu group.

= 2. Using widgets to show the donation form =

Donation Can comes with three widgets that you can use in your blog theme to present Donation Can features
to your visitors:

1. *Donation Form* allows you to show a donation form (optionally including a progress bar, description, and a list of latest donations).
1. *Latest Donations* is for listing latest donations to one or all of your goals on your blog.
1. *Fundraising Progress* shows a progress bar without a donation form.

= 3. Embedding a donation form to a page or a post =

Donation forms can be embedded to any post or page on your blog using the [donation-can] shortcode. You can
type the shortcode by hand, but it's probably easier to just click on the "Donation Form" button next to the
media upload buttons on your post editing page. This popup will create a correctly formatted donation for you
without any typing required.

For those interested in the details of the shortcode:

The shortcode requires one parameter (goal_id="donation_goal"), where "donation_goal" is one of the donation goals you have created in the plugin settings. In addition to that mandatory parameter, you can use the following parameters:

* show_progress: Set to "true" or "false" (default = "true")
* show_description: Set to "true" or "false" (default = "true")
* show_donations: Set to "true" or "false" (default = "false")
* show_title: Set to "true" or "false" (default = "true") 

These parameters are used as key-value pairs, e.g. "show_progress=false"

Example:

[donation-can goal_id="coffee" show_progress=false]
