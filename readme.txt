Collect PayPal donations towards multiple goals on your blog and show the progress to your visitors using sidebar widgets.

== Description ==

Donation Can is a WordPress plugin that lets you set goals (in dollars) and collect donations to meet them. Donations are
collected through PayPal and can be tracked inside your WordPress admin area separately for each goal.

Key features:

*   Define goals with name, description and amount of money required to meet the goal. For example "Help me buy a MacBook Pro" or "Save the rainforests."
*   Use WordPress widgets to define how and where the donation forms and progress bars are shown in your blog layout.
*   Be notified when someone makes a donation to one of your goals.
*   Follow the progress and browse donations inside the WordPress admin area.
*   Get a quick glance at the overall status of your donations using the Donation Can dashboard widget.
*   Customize (almost) everything.

The Plugin is completely FREE, but if you find it useful, it would be great if you took time to check out [Train for Humanity](http://trainforhumanity.org/) and help us support peace and development in Darfur by [sponsoring my training](http://trainforhumanity.org/author/jarkko). 

== Installation ==

Donation Can installation follows the standard way of most WordPress plugins:

1. Upload files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (preserve sub-directory structure)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

After the plugin has been installed, set up your PayPal information on the plugin settings page and define your first goal.
